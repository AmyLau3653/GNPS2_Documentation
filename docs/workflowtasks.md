## GNPS2 Task Management

GNPS2 tasks are specific instances of data processing of workflows. You can find the workflows [here](todo.md). 

### Task Status

There are three distinct statuses that matter:

* RUNNING
* DONE
* FAILED

### Resuming Tasks

If a task fails or is a weird state, you can go ahead and click the "Resume" button to have it try to restart. 

### Hiding a Task

A task can be hidden so that its not in the default list
