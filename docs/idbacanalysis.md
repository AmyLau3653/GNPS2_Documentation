## <ins> IDBac Analysis

**<ins>Submit workflow:** Select [idbac_analysis_workflow](https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=idbac_analysis_workflow) and reference the following image for submission instructions.

*If you do not submit metadata during this step, you will have fewer analysis options.

**<ins>Analysis options:** Once the idbac_analysis_workflow is complete, you have the ability to analyze your data through:

   i) Vizualize protein dendrogram: View a dendrogram of your isolates (excluding database seeds). 
   
   ii) Visualize with Metadata: If you selected a metadata column to display, it will appear within this protein dendrogram. If you do not select a metadata column to display, a 500 server error will display on-screen should you choose this analysis.
  
   iii) Spectra summary: This option allows you to compare mirror plots of your spectra.

   iv) Dendrogram similarity: You may view similarity scores between your isolates based on the similarity metric you chose in the analysis workflow submission.
   
   v) Database Search Summary: Here you query protein spectra of your unknown isolate against our database of characterized bacterial strains (based on similairty scores).
