The default spectral libraries are located in the speclibs folder in GNPS.

Additionally, separate libraries that are not selected by default can be added. 

These are propagated spectral libraries that inherently are less confident but this provides an avenue to give more identifications.

#### Candidate bile acid modification spectral library

The bile acid MS/MS spectral library consists of 21,549 spectra representing modifications to the bile acid steroid core. This library will not be added as a default library and will need to be added as an additional libraries for spectral matching while analyzing data as a molecular network. To get started on a molecular networking job follow the instructions in this GNPS documentation under Recommended Data Analysis section.

Step-by-step description of using the MS/MS spectral library in the GNPS environment is provided below:

1. Browse to the "GNPS-BILE-ACID-MODIFICATIONS" folder in the file selector.
2. Click on "Library Files" to add the bile acid spectral library.
3. Verify that the library now appears in the "Selected Library Files" category in the selection panel.
4. You can then submit your GNPS analyses.
