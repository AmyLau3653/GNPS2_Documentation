# Pan-ReDU

Welcome to the **Pan-ReDU**! 

## What is Pan-ReDU
**Finding and reusing data is hard.** ReDU aims to make that easier. ReDU is a community-minded approach to find and reuse public data containing Mass spectrometric data at the repository scale. It is a collection of metadata from [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/index), [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org), and [GNPS/MassIVE](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/datasets.jsp#%7B%22query%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22table_sort_history%22%3A%22createdMillis_dsc%22%2C%22title_input%22%3A%22GNPS%22%7D) within a single table with harmonized nomenclature. Our aim is to empower researchers to put their data in the context of public data as well as explore questions using public data at the repository scale.

## Components
There are three main components of ReDU to understand:

1. **Understand and navigate public metadata**
    - The Pan-ReDU dashboard can be found [here](https://redu.gnps2.org/selection/). Documentation on how to navigate the dashboard can be found on the next pages.
    - Explanations of collected metadata categories can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U0xnJUKa_mD0H_9suH1KJAlJD9io9e4chBX8EAHneE/edit?gid=1856413163#gid=1856413163).
    - Allowed terms per category can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U0xnJUKa_mD0H_9suH1KJAlJD9io9e4chBX8EAHneE/edit?gid=155945972#gid=155945972).

2. **How to contribute public metadata** 
    - Tools for [validating](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U0xnJUKa_mD0H_9suH1KJAlJD9io9e4chBX8EAHneE/edit?gid=1001603307#gid=1001603307) and [submitting](https://deposit.redu.gnps2.org/) metadata are explained on the next pages.

3. **How to downlaod raw data**
    - Download raw data file-by-file through the [GNPS2 Dataset Explorer](https://explorer.gnps2.org/) from any supported repository as explained on the next pages.
    - Download raw data in batch through our [public raw data downlaoder tool](https://github.com/Wang-Bioinformatics-Lab/downloadpublicdata) from any supported repository as explained on the next pages.
