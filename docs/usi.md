In GNPS2, you can also refer to spectra using the Universal Spectrum Identifier. The main resolver can be found at metabolomics-usi.gnps2.org. The format of the USI is as follows:

```
mzspec:GNPS2:TASK-${task}-input_file_folder/${row["filename"]}:scan:${row["scan1"]}
```

You can also access the gnps2 native resolver at
