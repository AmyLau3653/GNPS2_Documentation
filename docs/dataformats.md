## Raw Data

We generally accept two formats mzML and mzXML. These are preferred with some caveats on conversion. 

MGF is accepted but its frowned upon as a raw data format as its not really standardized. 

## MS/MS spectral libraries

We generally support libraries from GNPS, but we also note that you might want to use your own libraries. To that end you could make your own MGF file as a private library. You do miss out on other niceties within the GNPS2 ecosystem but it can be done. The format example is as follows:
