## Data Files Selection

There are two ways you can select files in GNPS2 for Classical Molecular Networking. 

1. Selection of Files uploaded to GNPS2
1. Selection of public files via USI

## Selection of Public Files via USI

Universal Spectrum Identifiers are a method to reference single spectra in public repositories. Here in GNPS2, we also use the prefix to identify full files themselves. 

You can get the USI for a file using the [GNPS2 Dataset Explorer](https://explorer.gnps2.org/?dataset_accession=MSV000086206&metadata_source=DEFAULT&metadata_option=f.MSV000086206%2Fmetadata%2Fmetadata.txt). 

Once you have gotten the USIs for the set of files you want to analyze, paste it into the "USI Files to Analyze" field. Data will automatically be downloaded and made available for analysis.
