# Welcome to GNPS2 Documentation

[GNPS2](https://gnps2.org/) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-source and open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS2 aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

As there are many aspects to GNPS, it can be a bit overwhelming. Here is a quick description of main functionalities:

1. Computational Workflows for the Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data
1. Interactive Visualizations of Mass Spectrometry Data and Results
1. Mass Spectrometry Knowledgebase Curation
1. Big Data Integration and Visualization
